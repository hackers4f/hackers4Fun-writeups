## Writeup

- We downloaded the animated GIF image that we split into 6 frames (http://picasion.com/split-animated-gif/).

- We go to the reading of QR codes (https://zxing.org/w/decode.jspx) where we get
**3L_4SCII_T3_4C3RC4RA_A_L4_FL4G_071_048_048_071_076_051_102_071_119_065_049**
- We decode the ASCII:
**G00GL3fGwA1**> URL shortener> https://goo.gl/3fGwA1
- We download the following artifact in a file called *PuNc3D_C4rD_H4F_R3T0_15.png* [MD5 62106ff952fd111752e0d034eedba573](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/c82e4d06f4d035487b8573b7f04a129015765b10ac740fb3cf733ba292ec5a44/details) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card).
